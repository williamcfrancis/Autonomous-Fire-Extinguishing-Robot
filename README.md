# Autonomous Fire Fighting Robot
A robot that autonomously detect and extinguish fire. It uses flame sensor for detection of fire and Arduino board for processing. Fire extinguisher along with an electronic valve (actuator) is used to extinguish the detected fire. The robot rotates while actively scanning for fire. This scanning is performed by sensors placed on either sides. When a fire is detected, it moves in the direction of fire and stops 30 cm in front of it and triggers the extinguisher to put off the fire. This project aimed to provide a solution to put out any fire with minimum human casualty. This robot could become a game changer in indoor facilities such as homes, industries and offices.
